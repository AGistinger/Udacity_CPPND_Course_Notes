    btw in the terminal it's actually not many commands
​[10:47 AM] Dennis, Blayne
    git add ./path/to/file
^^ this stages a file with changes for your next commit command. You can do this as many times as you want
​[10:48 AM] Dennis, Blayne
    git commit -m "your commit message"
^^ pushes your added changes with a commit message to your computer's local repository
​[10:49 AM] Dennis, Blayne
    git push -u origin your_repository_name
^^ pushes your committed changes to the github server's copy of the repository, which is what pull requests come from
​[10:49 AM] Dennis, Blayne
    So if you update inc/co.hpp:
git add ./inc/co.hpp
git commit -m "I improved co.hpp"
git push -u origin adriannes_repo
