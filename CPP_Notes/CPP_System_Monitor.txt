---Class Processor-----
CPU tag shows units of times (known as jiffies/clock ticks)
-add up the amount of all the time/jiffies and divide that by the total number of time/jiffies
-off all the time that has passed how much time has the CPU been active
-cpu 6211 9068 2916 198518 1441 0 22 0 0 0

user: normal processes executing in user mode
nice: niced processes executing in user mode
system: processes executing in kernel mode
idle: twiddling thumbs
iowait: waiting for I/O to complete
irq: servicing interrupts
softirq: servicing softirqs
steal: involuntary wait
guest: running a normal guest
guest_nice: running a niced guest
Formula
To calculate Linux CPU usage time subtract the idle CPU time from the total CPU time as follows:

Total CPU time since boot = user+nice+system+idle+iowait+irq+softirq+steal

Total CPU Idle time since boot = idle + iowait

Total CPU usage time since boot = Total CPU time since boot - Total CPU Idle time since boot

Total CPU percentage = Total CPU usage time since boot/Total CPU time since boot X 100
