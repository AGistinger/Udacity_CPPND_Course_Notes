Concepts Introduction

Compiled Langauges Vs Scripted Langauges

Advantages and Disadvantages
-Helps build stable and error free code
-Checks that you followed your own rules
-With a dynamic langauge you have to rely on completely testing your program
-Abstraction Mechanism
-Compiler can help you avoid stupid things
-Compiler will tell you errors where a dynamic language will send you to debug saying an error
-Compiler catches error systematically and early
-You have to think harder when you write code
-Generates much better code
-Runs faster

Advantages of a Dynamically Scripted Langauge
-You can run quickly
-You can run things even if they aren't completely correct
-You can do experiments with data
-It is slower
-Systems don't ever use just one langauge

C++ Types:
-Objects an only be used in accordance to its definition
-Statically typed
-To deal with hardware you have to reduce typechecking
-You can suppress the typechecking
-ex) if you have a integer and you want to make it a pointer

What is a Vector?
-Linear sequence of continuously allocated memory
-Linked list, hash sets, maps (lookup is much faster)

Comments:
-Say things that you can't do well in code
-Code doesn't tell you what at high level is being done
-"This is supposed to shell sort"
-Helps explain a complicated piece of code

2D Vector:
	vector<vector<int>> 2d_vec {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
