To-Do:
Write a read-me for the project
	-read-me must have instructions for setup
	-read-me must state which project has been chosen along with class structure and expected outcome.
	-read-me must include information about which ruberic points were completed
Compiling and testing
	-The project must compile and run with no errors
(Must meet 5 of the items below)
Loops, fuctions, I/O
	-Project must demonstrate understanding of control structures and functions
	-Project reads from a file and processes data or writes to a file(COMPLETE)
	-Project handles user input
-OOP
	-project code is organized into classes with class attributes(COMPLETE)
	-classes use correct access specifiers for class members(COMPLETE)
	-class contructors use initialization lists(COMPLETE)
	-classes are abstracted to implement details from their interfaces(COMPLETE)
	-classes encapsulate behavior(COMPLETE)
	-class follow inheritance hierarchy
	-overloaded functions allow the same functions to operate with different parameters
	-derived functions override virtual base class functions
	-templates generalize functions in the project
-Memory Management
	-project makes use of references in function declarations(COMPLETE)
	-project uses destructors appropriately
	-project uses scope/resource acquisiton RAII where appropriately
	-project follows the rule of 5(COMPLETE)
	-project uses move semantics to move data instead of copying
	-project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers
-Concurrency
	-project uses multithreading
	-a promise and future is used in the project
	-a mutex or lock is used in the project
	-a condition variable is used in the project
	
Turn snake game into a fish game:
-Have 3 different fish images read from a file along with the user character fish
-Have the 3 different fish have different sizes and randomly appear from the left and right sides of the screen and move in a straight line
-Each time the user eats a smaller fish it gets slightly bigger(COMPLETE)
-Each time the user tries to run into a larger fish the user is killed(COMPLETE)
-Once the user is the largest fish the user wins and the game is over
-Background should be changed to blue or an image(COMPLETE)
